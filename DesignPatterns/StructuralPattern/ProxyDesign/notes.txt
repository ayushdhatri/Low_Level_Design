Proxy is a Structural pattern because it controls and restructures how an object is accessed, 
without changing the object’s behavior or how it is created.

Everything related to access comes under structural pattern


Key Idea: Instead of accessing the real object directly, you access it through a proxy that can add extra functionality like:

Lazy initialization (create object only when needed)
Access control (check permissions)
Logging (track usage)
Caching (store results)
Remote access (object is on different server)


**** 

"I'd use Proxy when:

Object creation is expensive (lazy loading)
Need access control (security)
Want to add logging without changing original class
Object is on remote server (remote proxy)
Example: Loading high-resolution images in a photo gallery - show proxies initially, load real images only when user clicks."

Q1: Difference between Proxy and Decorator?

"Proxy controls access to an object and often creates it.
 Decorator adds behavior to an existing object.
  Proxy is about 'when/how to access', Decorator is about 'what extra to do'."
