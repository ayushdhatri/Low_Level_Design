What problem does the Decorator Pattern solve?
Problem statement:

You want to add new behavior to an object at runtime without modifying its existing code or creating too many subclasses.

Why this problem exists
Imagine:

You have a Coffee

You want:

Milk coffee

Sugar coffee

Milk + Sugar coffee

Milk + Sugar + Cream coffee

❌ If you use inheritance:

MilkCoffee

SugarCoffee

MilkSugarCoffee

MilkSugarCreamCoffee

👉 Class explosion problem.

Decorator Pattern solves this cleanly.
