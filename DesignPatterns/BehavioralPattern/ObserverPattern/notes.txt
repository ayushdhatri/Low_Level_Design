What problem does the Observer Pattern solve?
Problem statement (in simple words):

When one object changes state, many other objects may need to react to that change — without tightly coupling them together.

Real-life analogy
You subscribe to a YouTube channel

When a new video is uploaded:

All subscribers get notified

The channel does not care who you are

Subscribers can join or leave anytime

This is exactly what Observer Pattern models.

How to transition from theory to code (IMPORTANT)
In an interview, you should say:

“First, I’ll define Observer and Subject interfaces.
Then I’ll implement ConcreteSubject to manage state changes.
Finally, I’ll create ConcreteObservers that react via update()."
