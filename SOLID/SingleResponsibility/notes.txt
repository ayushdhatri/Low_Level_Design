**Reasons this class would change:**
1. ✅ Registration workflow changes (e.g., need to send SMS before email, or skip email for certain users)

**That's only 1 reason!**

- Validation rules change? → Only `UserValidator` changes
- Database changes? → Only `UserRepository` changes
- Email provider changes? → Only `EmailService` changes
- Logging changes? → Only `Logger` changes

## A Better Mental Model

Think of SRP in terms of **layers of abstraction**:
```
High-level policy (business workflow)
          ↓
UserRegistrationService ← This coordinates "WHAT" happens
          ↓
Low-level details (implementation)
          ↓
UserValidator, UserRepository, EmailService, Logger ← These handle "HOW"

**** One doubt that came to my mind ***
I want to understand here that in Single Responsiblity example you seperated the concern to different class
but in userREgistrationService class you have multiple responsiblity of
validation, userRespo, EmailServiced, Logger, then how you say that it is single responsiblity?

Understanding "Responsibility" vs "Orchestration"
The key distinction is between doing the work vs coordinating the work.
UserRegistrationService's SINGLE Responsibility
UserRegistrationService has ONE responsibility: "Orchestrating the user registration process"
It's not responsible for:

❌ HOW to validate (that's UserValidator's job)
❌ HOW to save to database (that's UserRepository's job)
❌ HOW to send emails (that's EmailService's job)
❌ HOW to log (that's Logger's job)
